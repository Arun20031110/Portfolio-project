      <br>
      <p class="para">I’m Arunachalam, a passionate learner exploring the world of web development and data science. My journey began with a simple curiosity about how websites are created and how technology shapes our daily lives. That curiosity slowly turned into a strong desire to build, learn, and grow through coding.<br>
         <br>
         I love creating clean, simple, and user-friendly websites that focus on both design and purpose. Every project I work on teaches me something new — from technical problem-solving to creative design thinking.<br>
         <br>
         Right now, I’m improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, with the goal of combining web and data technologies to create smarter digital experiences. I believe learning by doing is the best way to grow, and every small step I take brings me closer to becoming a better developer.<br>
         <br>
         Outside of coding, I enjoy watching tech videos, learning new tools, and exploring creative ideas that inspire innovation.
My goal is simple — to keep learning, keep building, and keep improving every single day.</p>

         <p class="para2">
           Over time, I’ve explored different areas of technology to understand how things work from both design and logic sides.<br>
My main focus is on web development and data science, and I’m continuously learning to improve my knowledge and creativity.<br>
<br>
I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helps me build responsive and interactive websites. I also use Python to analyze data, automate tasks, and experiment with data science concepts.<br>
<br>
Beyond coding, I’m interested in UI design, problem solving, and project planning — I believe these skills make a developer more complete and confident in real-world projects.<br>
<br>
I keep challenging myself through mini projects and learning platforms to stay consistent and grow step by step.<br>
<br>
My goal is to master both the creative and technical sides of technology — to build things that look good, work smoothly, and create real value.

     <h1 class="about">My Experience</h1><br>
     <p class="para2">
       Though I’m a fresher, I’ve gained strong practical experience through continuous learning, self-made projects, and real-world practice.
Every project I create helps me understand not just how to code — but how to think like a developer.<br>
<br>
I started by building small HTML and CSS websites, then moved into JavaScript-based interactive projects to make my designs more dynamic.<br>
Later, I explored Python and data science tools, experimenting with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to understand how data drives decisions.<br>
<br>
Through these projects, I’ve learned:
<br>
🧠 How to plan, design, and build from scratch
<br>
⚙️ How to debug and optimize my code
<br>
🎨 How to balance logic with creativity
<br>
🚀 How to stay consistent and self-motivated
<br>
<br>
I’ve also shared my progress through personal mini-projects and continuous practice — every day is part of my experience journey.
<br><br>
My goal is to move from self-learning to freelance and collaborative projects, where I can contribute ideas, solve problems, and grow with others in the tech field.
